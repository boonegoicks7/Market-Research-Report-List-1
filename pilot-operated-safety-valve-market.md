<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pilot Operated Safety Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Type</li><li>Non-closed Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Pilot Operated Safety Valve (POSV) market is categorized into closed and non-closed types based on their operational mechanisms. Closed type POSVs maintain system pressure by using a pilot system that opens or closes the valve in response to pressure changes, ensuring safety without releasing hazardous fluids. In contrast, non-closed type POSVs allow for direct discharge of fluid upon activation, often used in applications where immediate pressure relief is critical. Both types serve essential roles in industrial safety and pressure management.</p></p>
