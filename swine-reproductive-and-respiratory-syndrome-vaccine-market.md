<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Swine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Vaccine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Vaccine</li><li>Inactivated Vaccines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Swine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (SRRS) vaccine market comprises two main types: active and inactivated vaccines. Active vaccines contain live attenuated viruses that stimulate a strong immune response, providing long-lasting protection against SRRS. Inactivated vaccines, on the other hand, use killed viruses to trigger immunity without causing disease, offering a safer alternative but potentially requiring more doses for effective protection. Both types are crucial for managing SRRS in swine populations and ensuring herd health.</p></p>
