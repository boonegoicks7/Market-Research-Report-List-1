<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Caries Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transillumination</li><li>Laser Fluorescence</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Caries detectors are specialized dental tools that assist in the early identification of caries. The market features two primary types: transillumination and laser fluorescence. Transillumination uses light to reveal carious lesions by highlighting changes in enamel structure. In contrast, laser fluorescence employs a laser to detect decay by measuring fluorescence emitted by tooth structures, providing a visual representation of carious tissues. Both technologies enhance diagnostic accuracy and support preventive dentistry by facilitating timely intervention.</p></p>
